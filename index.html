    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 6, 2024</p>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with the PhotoStamperEasy mobile application (the "Service") owned by shawn.</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our mobile applications (the "Service").</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is based on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and accept all legal consequences. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, in whole or in part, please do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your Apple account management page.</p>

    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>We may, at our sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>

    <p>At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
    <p>We, in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

    <p>We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by us on a case-by-case basis and granted at our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>Our Service allows you to take time-stamped photos ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.</p>

    <p>By posting Content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service. You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post, or display on or through the Service, and you are responsible for protecting those rights.</p>

    <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person.</p>

    <p>We reserve all rights to block or remove communications or materials that we determine to be: (a) abusive, defamatory, or obscene; (b) fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading; (c) in violation of a copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right of another; or (d) offensive or otherwise unacceptable to us in our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>Accounts</h2>
    <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>

    <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

    <p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service and all contents, including but not limited to text, images, graphics, or code, are the property of [Your Company Name] and are protected by copyright, trademarks, database, and other intellectual property rights. You may display and copy, download or print portions of the material from the different areas of the Service only for your own non-commercial use. Any other use is strictly prohibited and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws. These Terms do not grant you a license to use any trademark of us or our affiliates. You further agree not to use, change or delete any proprietary notices from materials downloaded from the Service.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, if you breach the Terms.</p>

    <p>All provisions of the Terms shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless [Your Company Name], its principals, officers, directors, representatives, employees, contractors, licensors, licensees, suppliers, and agents, from and against any claims, losses, damages, obligations, costs, actions, or demands.</p>

    <p>These include but are not limited to: (a) legal and accounting fees resulting from your use of the Service; (b) your breach of any of these Terms; (c) anything you post on or upload to the Service; and (d) any activity related to your account. This includes any negligent or illegal conduct by you or any person or entity accessing the Service using your account, whether such access is obtained via fraudulent or illegal means.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>[Your Company Name], its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, shall not be liable for any loss or damage, direct or indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, economic loss, loss or damage to electronic media or data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your inability to access or use the Service; (iii) any conduct or content of any third-party on or related to the Service; (iv) any content obtained from or through the Service; and (v) the unauthorized access to, use of, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other claim in law, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer and Non-Waiver of Rights</h2>
    <p>[Your Company Name] makes no guarantees, representations, or warranties of any kind as regards the Service and associated technology. Any purportedly applicable warranties, terms, and conditions are excluded, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance, except as provided for under the laws of any jurisdiction. In such cases, the applicable law shall apply to the extent necessary.</p>

    <p>[Your Company Name], its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that (a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure, or available at any particular time or location; (b) any errors or defects will be corrected; (c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or (d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.</p>

    <p>If you breach any of these Terms and we choose not to immediately act, or choose not to act at all, we will still be entitled to all rights and remedies at any later date, or in any other situation, where you breach these Terms. We do not waive any of our rights. We shall not be responsible for any purported breach of these Terms caused by circumstances beyond our control. A person who is not a party to these Terms shall have no rights of enforcement.</p>

    <p>You may not assign, sub-license, or otherwise transfer any of your rights under these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Exclusions</h2>
    <p>As set out above, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. Applicable laws may apply to certain products and services provided.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California.</p>

    <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then any remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements, oral or otherwise, regarding the Service.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the Service.</p>
